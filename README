This program is a meme generator that uses two different API's in order to allow the user to either generate a random programming meme or create their own meme. A user can use this program by providing an input g, c, or q. If they want to generate a random meme, they should input g and the program will open a random meme from the API. If they want to create their own meme, they can input c which will prompt them to input a string for the top and bottom text of the meme.
